# tondev
TON Dev Environment

## Description 

This repo should became to a CLI develoment tool for TON blockchain. Kinda like hardhat for ETH.
Our top priority is to make TON easier to join for new developers.

Top level features to be done:

- In-depth docs for SCM development
- Ability to create template for SMC project
- Deploy of SMC's
- Local debug of SMC's
- Tests development


## Some ideas

We should create FunC compiler (build to WASM) NPM package for ease of use.

Also we need to standardize deployment process for SMC's and enteraction with them.

Since FunC is low-level language for TVM i think we should work on some high-level libraries for FunC that would help devs to write contracts without in-depth knowledge of TON.
